# XSS_Attack_Project
EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODERN PROTECTION TECHNIQUES AGAINST CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of modern protection solutions against XSS vulnerabilities on top used browsers.
The five recent vulnerable web applications that were tested in the project are as follows:
1) WordPress Plugin Quizlord 2.0
2) Joomla Core 3.9.1
3) Gila CMS 1.9.1
4) Rukovoditel ERP CRM 2.4.1
5) InoERP 0.6.



These vulnerable web applications were tested on different operating systems: Linux, Windows and Mac OS, and on the following browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge.



Three main common solutions against XSS were implemented : mod security web application firewall, content security policy and X-XSS- protection headers.
